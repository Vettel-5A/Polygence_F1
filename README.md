## O/V
Formula One Racing (F1) travels across the globe, racing in more than 20 countries each year. While the series has placed an increased focus on environmental sustainability, the calendar order of the races in the season has not been optimized, leading to excess carbon emissions. This project determines the most emissions-efficient order of the Formula 1 Season Race calendar to reduce the organizationâ€™s carbon footprint from transportation logistics.
